### Hello there!
 
I am Paige Downey, nice to meet you! I am currently a junior at Allegheny College. I love creative problem solving and developing cool stuff. I love contributing to useful tools or developing things with a creative aspect. I am a Computer Science major and an Economics minor. I am hoping to pursue a career in software development. While I may be fluent in just Python and Java at the moment, I am always excited to learn more and fill up my coding toolbox!
 
My main hobby is playing video games. I spend most of my free time playing games. Whether I am playing on my Nintendo Switch, my computer, or my phone, I keep myself entertained with a wide variety of games. I love games from various genres, but I particularly enjoy role playing games, roguelikes, and open world games.

### Exploring my interests through research.

As you probably already know, this website is serving as my online research notebook. During my Computer Science 580 class, I will be using research to explore my interests and posting various thoughts and findings here.

My initial point of interest was a vague intrigue in all things entertaining and creative in relation to computer science. I initially was considering exploring computer science in music, video games, or art. Since then, I have narrowed my interests down to *just* video games. While I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember, I have never actually looked into how they are made. Currently, my research has me looking into various free-to-use game engines, as well as game development concepts.

One concept in particular that has captured my interest is procedurally generated content and methods to implement it. While I don't grasp all of the details yet, I know that it is a driving force behind some of my favorite types of games. With procedurally generated content, game maps/levels can be generated using an algorithm, rather than being developed by hand. This fuels the pseudo-random elements of genres such as open world and roguelike games. In addition to producing unique gaming experiences, procedurally generating content as it is needed means that games can house the possibility for numerous outcomes without actually storing them initially. This means that the storage space required for the game is far less than it would be if it stored every possible map/level. Very interesting stuff! *(In my opinion at least!)*

I am very excited to continue learning more and I hope my research leads me down a path of intriguing discovery!

### Let's take a brief look at Godot!

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is an open source game engine, and another software tool that may come in handy during my research. While I have looked into Unity, I think it would be in my best interest to keep seeing what's out there! Godot is ***completely free*** and can be used to create games for a variety of platforms. Another aspect of Godot that interests me is that when you download it, you simply need to extract and run it. There is **no** installation required! Something to keep in mind when considering Godot is that it primarily uses the GDScript language: a programming language unique to Godot. Godot also supports C++ and C#, but GDScript is its main language. I don't mind this much though; I am willing to learn new languages during my research journey. The main pull towards Godot for me is its reduction of complexity. Since I am new to game development, a simpler game engine like this may be better suited for me.
 
I look forward to learning a bit more about Godot and perhaps getting some hands-on experience with it!

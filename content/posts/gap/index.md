### What isn't known?

A knowledge gap is the missing piece of information that would connect two pieces of thought within the research area.

The knowledge gap that emerges in my research is discovering what is the best way to generate a pseudo-randomized dungeon map for video games. Through all of the articles that discuss methods of doing this, none can necessarily declare a method to be the best. I can't help but wonder if some methods may produce more appealing game maps than others.

This gap seems to exist because there are just so many different ways that developers can use procedural content generation in video games. Some relevant literature provides motivation for the completion of the gap by creating a taxonomy of methods and concluding that they are all functional. For example, the survey by Hendrikx et al. discusses the many types of game content and the methods of procedurally generating them, but it does not conclude that any method is superior. Zafar et al. use the search-based method to generate dungeons, as well as create a metric to determine what a "good" map was. Although they only used one method, their metric to determine success is interesting and could be useful. The article by Khalifa et al. shows that even though they only used one method, changing values within their algorithm lead to a wide range of results to analyze. Similarly, Wu et al. used iterative machine learning for game map generation and found that tweaking the constraints widely impacted the output. It seems as though this field is so wide that method comparisons and success metrics are rarely found in the same research article.

The steps I could take to fill this knowledge gap would likely be to first continue researching methods of generating a dungeon map. In order to understand which methods may have the best outcomes, I will need to know the many methods out there first. It would also be helpful to see examples of the results of these methods. After conducting research, I would probably need to start doing my own experiments. This may mean that I will try out multiple generation methods, or try out those that are regarded as the best in literature. After conducting experiments, my results may point to one method being superior in dungeon map generation. If this is the case, this could answer my research question.
